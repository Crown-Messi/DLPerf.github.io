# Note: 
# 1. The keywords set contains 11 1-gram and 13 2-gram keywords. Every post that contain at least one of them will be considered a potential PB post, and should be manually checked later.
# 2. Words in posts should be stemmed with nltk.stem.PorterStemmer firstly, and then matched with the keywords set. 

# Difference between this keywords set and those used in previous empirical studies about performance bugs[1][2]:
# 1. This keywords set contains 2-gram keywords, which were initially derived from 2-grams that with a high TF-IDF value from preliminary tagged PB related posts, and then verified manually.
# 2. There are some deep learning specific keywords, such as "gpu util" and "gpu ram".
