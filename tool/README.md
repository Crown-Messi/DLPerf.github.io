## DeepPerf
### Requirements
- Python >= 3.8.0
- jedi >= 0.18.0

### Checker 1
Run `python graph_detect.py [project_path]` to check all python files in `[project_path]`.
You could specify `[project_path]` as `./test_code/graph` to check the default examples.
### Checker 2 and Checker 3
We have implemented Checker 2 and Checker 3 at the same time. Run `python data_detect.py [project_path]` to check all python files in `[project_path]`.
You could specify `[project_path]` as `./test_code/data` to check the default examples.
